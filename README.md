# Linear Regression Model

  A scientist that researches the _Rattus norvegicus_ species needs to comprehend the relationship between their weight and height. In order to solve his research problems, he conducted an analysis, using a linear regression model, to investigate the hypothetical linear correlation between the variables.
  
** Fake Data â€” the model was made using an example dataset **
